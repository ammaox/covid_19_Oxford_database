# list of ICU beds by Country

## INFO

This folder contains informations on the number of intensive care unit beds in various countries.
Data are available both in an exel spreadsheet an in csv file, a separate csv file contains the list of sources.

## DISCLAIMER
This list is far from complete, a lot of countries are missing including all of Africa and South America. \ 
Moreover different sources count ICU beds in different ways given that there is no precise definition of ICU bed [1].\
In compiling this list I tried to stick to reliable sources, the best of which seems to be the Intensive Care Medicine Journal https://www.springer.com/journal/134 \

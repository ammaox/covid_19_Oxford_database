## INFO

This folder contains informations on the number of intensive care unit beds in various countries.
Data are available both in an exel spreadsheet an in csv file, a separate csv file contains the list of sources.

## DISCLAIMER
This list is far from complete, a lot of countries are missing including all of Africa and South America. Moreover various sources counts ICU beds in different ways. However the number of ICU beds / 10k population seems to be a robust indicator.
